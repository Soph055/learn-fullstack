# Hydroponic Quiz Game

A simple and interactive **Hydropnic Quiz Game** based on my own personal hobby of hydroponics. It is built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Test your knowledge with multiple-choice questions and see your score instantly! This project also includes a **Dockerfile** to easily containerize and run the app.
