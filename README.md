# Learn-fullstack

Welcome to my **Learning full stack** repo!  
This is where I‚Äôm building up the skills I need before starting my **Spanish Full-Stack Project** over reading break.  

I‚Äôm using this space to:
To learn ->
- **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **Firebase**, **React**
- **AI integration** (using APIs like OpenAI or similar)
- Build small mini-projects for each topic.
- Track my progress and notes.
