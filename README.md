# learn-fullstack

Welcome to my **Practice & Learning** repo!  
This is where I’m building up the skills I need before starting my **Spanish Full-Stack Project** over reading break.  

I’m using this space to:
- Learn and practice **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **Firebase**, and **React**.
- Build small mini-projects for each topic.
- Track my progress and notes.
