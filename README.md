# Learn-fullstack

Welcome to my **Learning full stack** repo!  
This is where I’m building up the skills I need before starting my **Spanish Full-Stack Project** over reading break.  

## 🎯 Goals
I’m using this space to:
- Learn **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **Firebase**, and **React**
- Explore **AI integration** (using APIs like OpenAI or similar)
- Build small **mini-projects** for each topic or **notes**
- Track my **progress and notes**
